# python_training
Houses files for python training.

This document will list all files, code, training modules, and details around my personal training modules for learning python.
I have had no formal training in Python and wanted to share my insights and learnings around being self-taught and not having any computer science courses.
Please feel free to reach out if you notice an error, things you enjoyed, things that you felt were not explained properly, or ancillary learnings.

All these modules are free for you to use in the training and expand upon. Please feel free to experiment with the lessons and code we create to increase your knowledge.

Thank you for using this training session.
